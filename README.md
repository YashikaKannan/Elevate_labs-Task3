## Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression


##  What this Project is About ?

In this task, I:
- Explored a dataset containing house features (like area, bedrooms, etc.)
- Built a regression model using **scikit-learn**
- Predicted the price of houses 
- Evaluated how good (or bad) the model was
- Visualized how close the predictions were to the actual prices

---

## Tech :
- Python 
- Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## 🚀 What I Did (In Simple Steps)
1. Loaded the data and cleaned it up
2. Converted text columns (like “yes”/“no”) into numbers
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Built a **Linear Regression** model
5. Checked how well the model performed using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score (Goodness of Fit)
6. Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices to see how close the model was.
